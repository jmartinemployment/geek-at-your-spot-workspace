## You Don't Need Their Budget

**Purpose of this section:** This reveals the core value proposition - that small businesses can access the same technology used by Fortune 500 companies without enterprise budgets. This builds trust and positions Geek @ Your Spot as the bridge between enterprise-grade solutions and small business affordability.

**What to include:**
- Reveal that enterprise solutions use open-source or accessible technology
- Explain where the enterprise markup comes from (consulting fees, proprietary platforms, over-engineering)
- Reassure that "stripping away enterprise bloat" makes it affordable
- Build credibility by naming the actual tech stack

**Example:**
```
Here's what I learned implementing [service] for Florida businesses: **the same [technology] powering [major company] is open-source and free. The cost is [setup/configuration], not licensing.**

The markup comes from:
- Enterprise [platform type] charging $50,000-500,000/year
- Consultants at $200-400/hour for months of engagement
- Overengineered solutions with features you'll never use
- Proprietary tools locking you into vendor ecosystems

Strip away the enterprise bloat, and Florida businesses get [benefit] for fraction of the cost.
```
